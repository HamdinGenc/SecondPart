Git Class 4:
What is Git:?
-Git is version control system,that helps us to keep track and backup our project!

What is GitHub?
-GitHub is a remote location where we can have our backed up codes safe for future references.
-We can work in collaboration on the same project.

What is a Local Repo?
-A repo is a storage area, and by local it means it is on our system

What is remote Repo?
-a storage are,and by remote means it is on the on the internet!

----------------------------------------------

Tracking our first project using Git:
**-->Create a new project in Intellij and in order to start tracking it follow the
following steps:

Step -->1.The first step find the location of your project.(in intellij the path is
written in front of project name,you can also right click
on project name and the click on open in explorer.
Step -->2.Decide the location where you want to create your project.(Please do not create a repo
within a repo)
Step -->3 Navigate your terminal to the location of your project.

Initializing(starting)the repo:
Step 1--> On Git bash.
->pwd(Find the locator)
-->git init

******3-Stage architecture:--->Git has three Stage architecture and they are:
1-Working Directory.
2-Staging Area
3-Repo
Working directory--->:all the files that you have in your project
Staging area-->:An area between repo and working directory,here the snapshot
of all the files are moved before actually moving them to repo.
-->Repo:Our actual storage are.

Step 2-->git status command
-tells the status of repo,
-and the untracked files
-files that are in staging are but not in repo yet!
-It does not tell us about files in staging area  which are also in repo!
-untracked files appeared RED color
-tracked -->the files  in staging area are appearing in Green color



GitHub:
-For each local repo you must have a unique individual remote repo!!!
1.Create a new Remote Repo:
2.On your terminal " git remote -v" to check any connections(if empty shows  no connection yet)
3.git remote add origin URL
4.Git branch -M main(naming your branch)

NoteImp-->you need to do all these steps only once after creation of a new repo!
         after that you do not need them unless,
         you want to change your connection.

5.git push  -u origin main--->use it first time only.
6.After that you can just type  it "git push" command  only command.
--------------------------

git remote remove origin--> is to remove the connection of local with remote.

use, git add filename to just  your desired file in staging area.

git log--> shows us all the commits in your local repo.
Head->points to the latest commit that is present in your working directory.
origin. main--? points to the commit in your local repo uptil which your remote repo is synchronized

---------------
extra commands:
1.git ls-files:
show you the files that are present in the staging area.


*You can not overwrite a file in staging area.Git is going to tell that  hey you already have some changes in
staging area that needs to be in the repo.

2.git rm --cached filename:
removes the files from the staging area.

3.git diff:
shows you the difference between the files in working directory and the staging area!!!
